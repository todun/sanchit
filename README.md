PennApps Fall 2012

=======

Create an app at developers.facebook.com (name matters a lot, app namespace matters less)
- Make mobile url equal to http://localhost:8888 (see server.sh)
- If you deploy, update "website for Facebook login" and "app domain" to match where you deploy (feel free to ask for help if needed)

Remember to update the app id in the javascript code in order to run it with your app.

Get login example from http://github.com/ryandm/sanchit (uses JS authentication)

Use graph explorer / read the login example code to see what's possible: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer (keep in mind that the FB.api call in javascript automatically adds the access token to every request)

Feel free to find me or email me (git hub user name at fb dot com) if you run into problems or want some help hacking something API related and adding it to this repo.
